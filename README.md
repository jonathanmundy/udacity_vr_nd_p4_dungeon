# Puzzler Project for VR Nanodegree

This is my submission for the Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree Puzzler project. I designed and built a mobile VR application that takes a user through a dungeon-based memory puzzle. I took an iterative approach to creating the app, sketching some initial designs, before user tessting the app throughout the creation stages. I incorporated the feedback from user testing into each iteration of the Puzzler app.

### Initial Foundations

The Udacity team provided the base materials and foundational scripts, which I used to build out the app. The starting point was to achieve a realistic world-scale from the initial assets, and iterate from there. 

## Puzzler

I iterated on the app based on feedback from the family members and colleagues I asked to user test the project. The overall approach was based on the advice given by the Udacity team in the course. The user testing definitely helped to produce a much better outcome than the initial versions, and helped produce an easy entry for inexperienced VR consumers.

## Process

### Statement of purpose

_Puzzler is a mobile VR application for new VR users which challenges them to solve a familiar type of puzzle in a new way._

## Persona

#### Elsie

Elsie is a 39 year old mother who like to fire up her smartphone when the kids are in bed. She needs something interesting to entertain her when she finally gets to relax on the sofa after a long day of parenting.

Her VR experience is limited to a couple of cardboard apps. She only has about 30 minutes to kill between putting the kids to bed and her husband getting home from work. She likes puzzle-based games and after trying some cardboard apps round a friend's house she has her own viewer, but hasn't used it yet.

She's got no experience of a proper VR HMD, although she thinks she might try one if she enjoys VR on her phone.

## Sketches

I started out by sketching some of the key elements of the experience, trying to prototype out the options in the least expensive way, before building the app in Unity.
